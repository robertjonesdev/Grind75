Jeff, Norbert and Chris are all government people. The interview will be a mix of technical and behavioral questions. Jeffrey and Norbert have been on CPCE and similar programs for a while now, so they have a strong grasp of where AFATDS has been, as well as direction for the future. Jeff and Norbert come from a Systems Engineering background, so expect focused technical questions about how your engineering experience can be applied to this program. Chris has extensive experience on AFATDS, and he is technical as well.

Helpful Info:
AFATDS AXS (Artillery Execution Suite) is the modernization of the primary Fire Support Command and Control application for the Army. AXS will replace the current AFATDS baseline and is being built using a Modular Open System Approach as an agile software program. Jay Samuel, one of RII's engineers on the program, will call you ttomorrow to prep you for tomorrow.

Job Description:
The team is responsible for the persistence layer of AXS. They develop a Spring Boot microservice that exposes REST-based and message-based APIs that hide the persistence-level implementation details. They utilize code generation techniques to more quickly handle data model updates that are provided from the System Engineering Team. They utilize Java Persistence API (JPA) for database updates and retrievals when working with the Postgres relational database.
