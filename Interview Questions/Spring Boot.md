### 1. **What is Spring Boot, and how does it simplify Spring application development?**

- **Explanation:** Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the setup, configuration, and deployment of Spring applications. It provides auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features like metrics and health checks.
- **Follow-up:** Discuss how Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code and speeds up development compared to traditional Spring.

---

### 2. **What are the key features of Spring Boot?**

- **Explanation:** Key features include:
  - Auto-configuration
  - Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)
  - Spring Boot Starters for dependency management
  - Actuator for monitoring and managing applications
  - Externalized configuration (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`)
- **Follow-up:** Provide examples of how you’ve used these features in real projects.

---

### 3. **What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?**

- **Explanation:** Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications, while Spring Boot is a module of Spring that simplifies the development process by providing defaults and reducing configuration.
- **Follow-up:** Explain when you would use Spring Boot over traditional Spring.

---

### 4. **How does Spring Boot Auto-Configuration work?**

- **Explanation:** Auto-configuration uses conditional beans and classpath scanning to automatically configure Spring applications based on the dependencies present in the project. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` is included, Spring Boot configures a `DataSource` and `EntityManager` automatically.
- **Follow-up:** Discuss how to override or customize auto-configuration.

---

### 5. **What are Spring Boot Starters, and how do they work?**

- **Explanation:** Starters are dependency descriptors that bundle commonly used libraries for specific functionalities (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web` for web applications, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for database access). They simplify dependency management by providing a curated set of dependencies.
- **Follow-up:** Name a few starters you’ve used and their purposes.

---

### 6. **How do you manage external configurations in Spring Boot?**

- **Explanation:** Spring Boot supports externalized configuration through `application.properties`, `application.yml`, environment variables, and command-line arguments. It uses a hierarchical property source system to resolve configurations.
- **Follow-up:** Discuss how to use profiles (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`) for environment-specific configurations.

---

### 7. **What is Spring Boot Actuator, and how have you used it?**

- **Explanation:** Actuator provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`). It helps in managing and monitoring applications in production.
- **Follow-up:** Share examples of how you’ve used Actuator to monitor or troubleshoot applications.

---

### 8. **How do you handle database connectivity in Spring Boot?**

- **Explanation:** Spring Boot simplifies database connectivity by auto-configuring a `DataSource` when dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` or `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` are included. It also supports connection pooling (e.g., HikariCP).
- **Follow-up:** Discuss how you configure and optimize database connections in a Spring Boot application.

---

### 9. **How do you implement security in a Spring Boot application?**

- **Explanation:** Spring Security can be integrated into Spring Boot to handle authentication and authorization. It supports various mechanisms like OAuth2, JWT, and basic authentication.
- **Follow-up:** Provide an example of how you’ve implemented security in a Spring Boot project.

---

### 10. **How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?**

- **Explanation:** Spring Boot provides several ways to handle exceptions, such as using `@ControllerAdvice` for global exception handling, `@ExceptionHandler` for controller-specific exceptions, and custom error responses.
- **Follow-up:** Share an example of how you’ve implemented exception handling in a real-world application.

---

### Bonus Questions:

1. **How do you deploy a Spring Boot application?**

   - **Explanation:** Spring Boot applications can be deployed as standalone JAR files with embedded servers or as WAR files to external servers like Tomcat.
   - **Follow-up:** Discuss deployment strategies for cloud environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

2. **What is the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller` in Spring Boot?**

   - **Explanation:** `@Controller` is used for traditional web applications that return views, while `@RestController` is a specialized version of `@Controller` that returns data directly (e.g., JSON/XML) for RESTful web services.
   - **Follow-up:** Provide examples of when to use each.

3. **How do you optimize the performance of a Spring Boot application?**
   - **Explanation:** Techniques include using connection pooling, caching (e.g., Spring Cache), asynchronous processing, and optimizing database queries.
   - **Follow-up:** Share specific optimizations you’ve implemented.
