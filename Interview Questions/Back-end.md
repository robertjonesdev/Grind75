Here are **10 back-end development interview questions** that a mid-career full-stack software developer might encounter, along with detailed answers:

---

### 1. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**

**Answer:**

- **SQL Databases:**
  - Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - Use structured schemas with tables, rows, and columns.
  - Support ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  - Ideal for complex queries and relationships.
- **NoSQL Databases:**
  - Non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
  - Use flexible schemas (e.g., key-value, document, graph).
  - Scale horizontally and handle large volumes of unstructured data.
  - Ideal for high scalability and flexibility.

### 2. **Explain RESTful APIs and their principles.**

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Key principles include:

- **Statelessness:** Each request contains all the information needed to process it.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns between client and server.
- **Uniform Interface:** Consistent resource identification (e.g., URIs) and manipulation (e.g., HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Cacheability:** Responses can be cached to improve performance.
- **Layered System:** Intermediary servers (e.g., load balancers) can be added without affecting the client-server communication.

### 3. **What is database indexing, and how does it improve performance?**

**Answer:**

- **Database Indexing:** A data structure (e.g., B-tree) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.
- **How it improves performance:**
  - Reduces the number of rows scanned by creating a shortcut to locate data.
  - Speeds up `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `JOIN` queries.
- **Trade-offs:**
  - Increases storage space.
  - Slows down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations because the index must be updated.

### 4. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**

**Answer:**

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT).
- **Authorization:** Determines what actions a user is allowed to perform (e.g., role-based access control).

Example:

- Authentication: Logging in with a username and password.
- Authorization: Allowing an admin user to delete a record but restricting a regular user from doing so.

### 5. **What is a microservices architecture, and what are its advantages and challenges?**

**Answer:**

- **Microservices Architecture:** A design pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
- **Advantages:**
  - Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently.
  - Flexibility: Different services can use different technologies.
  - Fault Isolation: Failure in one service doesn’t affect others.
- **Challenges:**
  - Complexity: Requires robust communication and monitoring.
  - Data Consistency: Harder to maintain ACID transactions across services.
  - Deployment: Requires CI/CD pipelines and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

### 6. **What is the CAP theorem, and how does it apply to distributed systems?**

**Answer:**

- **CAP Theorem:** States that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties:
  - **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
  - **Availability:** Every request receives a response (success or failure).
  - **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite network partitions.
- **Application:** Distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) often prioritize **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance** (AP), while relational databases prioritize **Consistency** and **Availability** (CA).

---

### 7. **What is caching, and how can it improve back-end performance?**

**Answer:**

- **Caching:** Storing copies of data in a temporary storage location (e.g., memory) to reduce the need to fetch it from the original source.
- **How it improves performance:**
  - Reduces database load by serving frequently accessed data from cache.
  - Speeds up response times for read-heavy applications.
- **Types of Caching:**
  - **In-Memory Caching:** Using tools like Redis or Memcached.
  - **Browser Caching:** Storing static assets (e.g., images, CSS) in the user’s browser.
  - **CDN Caching:** Distributing cached content across edge servers.

---

### 8. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**

**Answer:**

- **Synchronous Programming:**
  - Tasks are executed sequentially, one at a time.
  - The program waits for each task to complete before moving to the next.
  - Example: Blocking I/O operations.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Tasks are executed concurrently, without waiting for previous tasks to complete.
  - Improves performance by allowing non-blocking operations.
  - Example: Using callbacks, promises, or async/await in JavaScript.

---

### 9. **What is a message queue, and how is it used in back-end systems?**

**Answer:**

- **Message Queue:** A system that allows applications to communicate by sending and receiving messages asynchronously.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Decoupling services (e.g., sending emails in the background).
  - Handling high volumes of requests by processing them in batches.
  - Ensuring reliable delivery of messages (e.g., retries, dead-letter queues).
- **Examples:** RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS.

### 10. **How do you handle database migrations in a production environment?**

**Answer:**

- **Database Migrations:** Managing changes to the database schema (e.g., adding tables, modifying columns) in a controlled and reversible way.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use migration tools (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, Django Migrations).
  - Test migrations in a staging environment before applying them to production.
  - Backup the database before running migrations.
  - Write idempotent migrations (can be run multiple times without side effects).
  - Use version control to track migration scripts.

Example:

```sql
-- Example migration script
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```
