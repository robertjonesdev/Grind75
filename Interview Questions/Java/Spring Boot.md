Sure! Here are the answers to your Java interview questions:

---

### 1. **Difference between Spring and Spring Boot**
- **Spring**: A lightweight, modular framework for building enterprise Java applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for dependency injection, transaction management, and more. However, it requires a lot of manual configuration.
- **Spring Boot**: Built on top of Spring, it simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing defaults and auto-configuration. It also includes embedded servers (like Tomcat) and eliminates the need for XML configuration.

---

### 2. **How does a Spring Boot application determine the active profile?**
Spring Boot determines the active profile using:
- The `spring.profiles.active` property in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
- Command-line arguments (`--spring.profiles.active=dev`).
- Environment variables.
- If no profile is specified, the `default` profile is used.

---

### 3. **How to integrate multiple databases in a Spring Boot application?**
- Define multiple `DataSource` beans in the configuration class.
- Use `@Primary` to mark the primary `DataSource`.
- Use `@Qualifier` to differentiate between the `DataSource` beans.
- Configure each database connection in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

---

### 4. **What is the difference between a Filter and an Interceptor?**
- **Filter**: Part of the Servlet API, it intercepts requests before they reach the DispatcherServlet. It works at the web server level.
- **Interceptor**: Part of Spring MVC, it intercepts requests during the processing of a controller. It works at the Spring context level.

---

### 5. **Explain the MVC workflow from frontend to backend.**
1. The client sends an HTTP request.
2. The DispatcherServlet receives the request and routes it to the appropriate controller.
3. The controller processes the request, interacts with the service layer, and returns a model and view.
4. The view resolver maps the view name to a specific view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
5. The view renders the response, which is sent back to the client.

---

### 6. **Authorization vs Authentication**
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., username/password, OAuth tokens).
- **Authorization**: Determines if the authenticated user has permission to access a resource.

---

### 7. **How do you connect to a database in Spring Boot?**
- Add the database dependency (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`).
- Configure the database connection in `application.properties` or `application.yml` (e.g., `spring.datasource.url`, `username`, `password`).
- Use Spring Data JPA or JDBC to interact with the database.

---

### 8. **Can we maintain sessions in REST APIs?**
REST APIs are stateless, so sessions are not maintained. However, you can use tokens (e.g., JWT) to manage user state securely.

---

### 9. **What is Lombok?**
Lombok is a library that reduces boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, constructors, and other methods at compile time using annotations like `@Data`, `@Getter`, `@Setter`, etc.

---

### 10. **What is the Dispatcher Servlet?**
The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring MVC. It handles incoming HTTP requests, routes them to the appropriate controllers, and manages the workflow of the application.

---

### 11. **What are Spring Security and Spring Cloud?**
- **Spring Security**: A framework for securing Spring applications, providing authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.
- **Spring Cloud**: A suite of tools for building microservices-based applications, including service discovery, configuration management, and load balancing.

---

### 12. **What is the IOC Container?**
The Inversion of Control (IOC) container is the core of Spring. It manages the lifecycle of beans and their dependencies, injecting them where needed.

---

### 13. **What is Dependency Injection and its types? Which is recommended and why?**
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A design pattern where objects are provided with their dependencies rather than creating them internally.
- **Types**: Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Field Injection.
- **Recommended**: Constructor Injection, as it ensures immutability and makes dependencies explicit.

---

### 14. **What does @SpringBootApplication do?**
