Here are **10 interview questions** about **cloud deployment (AWS)** as it relates to **front-end development**, along with detailed answers:

---

### 1. **How can you deploy a static front-end application (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue) on AWS?**

**Answer:**
You can deploy a static front-end application on AWS using **Amazon S3** (Simple Storage Service) for hosting and **CloudFront** for content delivery. Here's how:

1.  Build your front-end application (e.g., `npm run build` for React).
2.  Upload the build files to an S3 bucket.
3.  Enable static website hosting in the S3 bucket settings.
4.  Use CloudFront as a CDN to distribute the content globally and improve performance.
5.  Optionally, configure a custom domain using Route 53.

### 2. **What is Amazon S3, and how is it used in front-end deployment?**

**Answer:**
Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service. For front-end deployment:

- It stores static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- It can be configured to host static websites.
- It integrates with CloudFront for faster content delivery.

Example use case:

- Upload a React app's `build` folder to an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.

### 3. **What is AWS CloudFront, and why is it useful for front-end applications?**

**Answer:**
AWS CloudFront is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** that caches and delivers content from edge locations closer to users. It is useful for front-end applications because:

- It reduces latency by serving content from the nearest edge location.
- It improves performance and scalability.
- It supports HTTPS for secure content delivery.
- It integrates with S3 for hosting static websites.

### 4. **How do you set up a custom domain for a front-end application hosted on AWS?**

**Answer:**
To set up a custom domain:

1.  Register a domain using **AWS Route 53** or another domain registrar.
2.  Create a CloudFront distribution for your S3 bucket.
3.  Add an **Alternate Domain Name (CNAME)** in the CloudFront distribution settings.
4.  Create a Route 53 **Alias record** to point your domain to the CloudFront distribution.
5.  Optionally, configure an SSL certificate using **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for HTTPS.

---

### 5. **What is AWS Amplify, and how does it simplify front-end deployment?**

**Answer:**
AWS Amplify is a development platform that simplifies front-end deployment by providing:

- **Hosting:** Automatically deploys and hosts static websites.
- **CI/CD:** Integrates with Git for continuous deployment.
- **Backend services:** Adds features like authentication, APIs, and databases.
- **Custom domains:** Easily configure custom domains and SSL certificates.

Example workflow:

- Connect your Git repository to Amplify.
- Amplify automatically builds and deploys your app on every push.

---

### 6. **How do you secure a front-end application hosted on AWS?**

**Answer:**
To secure a front-end application:

- Use **HTTPS** by configuring an SSL certificate with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and CloudFront.
- Restrict access to your S3 bucket using **bucket policies** (e.g., allow access only through CloudFront).
- Enable **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to protect against common web exploits.
- Use **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** to restrict access to your APIs.

---

### 7. **What is AWS Lambda, and how can it be used with front-end applications?**

**Answer:**
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events. It can be used with front-end applications to:

- Handle backend logic (e.g., form submissions, API requests).
- Process data or trigger workflows.
- Integrate with other AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).

Example use case:

- A front-end app sends a request to an API Gateway, which triggers a Lambda function to process the request and return a response.

---

### 8. **How do you handle environment variables for a front-end application deployed on AWS?**

**Answer:**
Environment variables can be handled in several ways:

- **AWS Amplify:** Configure environment variables in the Amplify console.
- **S3 and CloudFront:** Inject environment variables during the build process (e.g., using a build tool like Webpack).
- **Lambda@Edge:** Use Lambda functions to modify responses and inject environment variables dynamically.

Example (Webpack):

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const webpack = require("webpack");
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      "process.env.API_URL": JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
    }),
  ],
};
```

---

### 9. **What is AWS CodePipeline, and how can it be used for front-end CI/CD?**

**Answer:**
AWS CodePipeline is a CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deployment process. For front-end applications:

- Set up a pipeline to trigger on code changes (e.g., from a Git repository).
- Use **AWS CodeBuild** to build the application (e.g., `npm install` and `npm run build`).
- Deploy the build artifacts to S3 or Amplify.

Example workflow:

1.  Push code to a Git repository.
2.  CodePipeline triggers a build in CodeBuild.
3.  The built artifacts are deployed to S3 or Amplify.

### 10. **How do you monitor and debug a front-end application deployed on AWS?**

**Answer:**
To monitor and debug:

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor logs, metrics, and alarms.
- Enable **CloudFront logging** to track requests and errors.
- Use **AWS X-Ray** to trace requests and identify performance bottlenecks.
- Use browser developer tools to debug client-side issues.

Example:

- Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you of high error rates or latency.
- Use X-Ray to trace API requests and identify slow backend processes.
